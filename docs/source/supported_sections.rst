Supported Sections
==================

Due to the time-consuming nature of adding in all sections and appropriately type-checking/checking for valid input,
not all sections are supported yet. Below, we have listed the input sections currently supported. We hope to support the
full API in the near future. We will not cover the input sections in more detail, as they are already documented in the CP2K
manual (https://manual.cp2k.org/).

To be listed. See mosdef_cp2k_writer/classes.
